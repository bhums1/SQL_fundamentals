Now, using the sales_data table, you can run various analytical queries. Here's an example query to find the total sales for each product in the last quarter:


WITH sales_summary AS (
    SELECT
        product, 
        SUM(quantity * price) AS total_sales,
        COUNT(*) AS total_transactions
    FROM
        sales_data
    WHERE
        date BETWEEN '2024-04-01' AND '2024-06-30'
    GROUP BY
        product
)
SELECT
    product,
    total_sales,
    total_transactions
FROM
    sales_summary
WHERE
    total_sales > 1000
ORDER BY
    total_sales DESC
LIMIT
    10;
